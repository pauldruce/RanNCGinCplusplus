# Random NCG in C++
The overall aim of this project is to create a easily modifiable library for using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to investigate Finite spectral triples, known as Fuzzy Spaces.  

Firstly, the results of El Glaser and John Barrett. 

The aim is then to instegate a new type of Random Fuzzy Space. 


## Dependencies
This project uses:
- [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net), see their GitLab [here](https://gitlab.com/conradsnicta/armadillo-code). 
  The install of armadillo may vary from platform to platform. Visit their website for instructions. 
  The Cmake this project uses searches for the installed package. 
- [cppitertools]() which is listed as a git submodule. Before building run the commands 
  ```
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  ```
  in the root of this directory.
