# Random NCG in C++
The overall aim of this project is to create a easily modifiable library for using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to investigate Finite spectral triples, known as Fuzzy Spaces.  

Firstly, the results of El Glaser and John Barrett. 

The aim is then to instegate a new type of Random Fuzzy Space.
